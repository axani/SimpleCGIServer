SimpleCGIServer
===============

A little Python script to create a simple CGI server. It automatically opens an index.html on the server to test if the CGI-scripts work.

## What is it good for
With a local CGI-server you can run python scripts locally as backend scripts for websites.

## How to
1. Download the SimpleCGIServer-folder
2. Open Terminal.app
3. Terminal: Type *"cd "* (Without the quotes. DonÂ´t forget the space after it.)
4. Finder: Drag the SimpleCGIServer-folder into the Terminal window
5. Terminal: Press enter
6. (Now your browser should open at "http://0.0.0.0:8888", where you see the index.html file.)
7. Test if everything works as expected.
